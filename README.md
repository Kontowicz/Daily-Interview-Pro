### Problem 4
This problem was asked by Uber.

Imagine you are building a compiler. Before running any code, the compiler must check that the parentheses in the program are balanced. Every opening bracket must have a corresponding closing bracket. We can approximate this using strings.

Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.
An input string is valid if:
- Open brackets are closed by the same type of brackets.
- Open brackets are closed in the correct order.
- Note that an empty string is also considered valid.
