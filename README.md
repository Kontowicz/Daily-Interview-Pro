### Problem 1
This problem was asked by Microsoft.

You are given two linked-lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.

### Problem 4
This problem was asked by Uber.

Imagine you are building a compiler. Before running any code, the compiler must check that the parentheses in the program are balanced. Every opening bracket must have a corresponding closing bracket. We can approximate this using strings.

Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:
- Open brackets are closed by the same type of brackets.
- Open brackets are closed in the correct order.
- Note that an empty string is also considered valid.

### Problem 8
This problem was asked by Facebook.

You are given a list of numbers, and a target number k. Return whether or not there are two numbers in the list that add up to k.

### Problem 9
This problem was asked by Facebook.

Given a list of numbers, where every number shows up twice except for one number, find that one number.

### Problem 10
This problem was asked by Microsoft.

You are given an array of integers in an arbitrary order. Return whether or not it is possible to make the array non-decreasing by modifying at most 1 element to any value.
We define an array is non-decreasing if array[i] <= array[i + 1] holds for every i (1 <= i < n).

### Problem 11
This problem was asked by Apple.

Given an integer k and a binary search tree, find the floor (less than or equal to) of k, and the ceiling (larger than or equal to) of k. If either does not exist, then print them as None.

### Problem 12
This problem was asked by Twitter.

You are given the root of a binary tree. Invert the binary tree in place. That is, all left children should become right children, and all right children should become left children.

### Problem 13
This problem was asked by Twitter.

Implement a class for a stack that supports all the regular functions (push, pop) and an additional function of max() which returns the maximum element in the stack (return None if the stack is empty). Each method should run in constant time.
